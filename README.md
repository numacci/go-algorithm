# go-algorithm
Algorithms and Data Structures in Golang.
These libraries are assumed to be used in competitive programming, so errors are not handled strictly.

## Standard Library
Standard Libraries in C++.

### STL Function
* Abs
* GCD
* LCM
* Max
* Min
* Binary Search
* Next Permutation
* Pop Count (Only Example)
* Reverse (Only Example)
* Sort (Only Example)
 
### STL Data Structure
We can simply create the following data structures
by built-in structs such as map and slice.

If you want to implement set, queue and stack yourself,
please refer to [Data Structure](#ds) directory.

* Set (Only Example)
* Queue (Only Example)
* Stack (Only Example)
* Priority Queue (Int Heap)
